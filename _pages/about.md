## StudioRich

StudioRich is a live lo-fi studio built for late nights, focus, and quiet presence.

We stream short, intentional sessions — no idle loops, no filler — designed to feel like a place you return to rather than content you scroll past.

Built slowly. Broadcast quietly.

### What We Do

- Live lo-fi & ambient streams
- Experimental soundscapes
- Late-night sessions for focus, sleep, and creativity

This is not background noise.  
It’s a place to stay awhile.
