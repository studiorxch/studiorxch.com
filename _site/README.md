# 🔒 Magic Link + User Settings (Temporarily Disabled) — 2025-11-18
The Magic Link login system, user-settings scripts, and theme-toggle functions have been intentionally disabled across the site to prevent conflicts with the new PWA architecture. These features are still fully intact in the repo (/assets/js/magicLink.js, user-settings.js, theme-toggle.js) but are no longer loaded by the layout. This prevents stale service worker interactions, caching errors, and mixed-mode UI states while we stabilize the global audio stream and PWA foundation. When authentication and personalization return, simply reconnect the scripts in _layouts/default.html and rebuild the UI hooks.
